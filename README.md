I’m @Dilshan, an Undergraduate Software Engineer specializing in full-stack development across web, mobile, and desktop platforms.

I design and build fast, scalable, and user-centric applications using modern, cloud-ready full-stack architectures, with hands-on experience in real-time, event-driven systems and API-first application design. My work emphasizes clean architecture, performance optimization, and intuitive, data-driven UI/UX experiences.

Currently, I’m expanding into DevOps and Cloud engineering, focusing on CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure, and deployment automation to deliver reliable, production-ready systems. Beyond engineering, my background in forex trading and economic analysis strengthens my strategic thinking, risk assessment, and problem-solving abilities—enabling me to design systems that scale, adapt, and perform under real-world demands.
